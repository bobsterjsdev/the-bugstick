The Bugstick is a remastered/rewrite & updated version of the older bot "Likke Potato" created by myself. The bot source files will be open source when i believe this project is complete and is good enough for public release.

You can join this [discord](https://discord.gg/78DMCjZatu) to test the bot and special non-release features

### Release Plan

The Bugstick will release as a fully functional bot for a whole month to get feedback on the bot and fix bugs/issues. After the month the bot source files will be released to the public so you yourself can make a home-hosted one or contribute via pull requests. All will be accepted
